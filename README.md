# UR3 CobotOps ML Project

This project explores the **UR3 CobotOps dataset** using machine learning techniques, specifically clustering analysis, to uncover operational insights into collaborative robot (cobot) behavior. The analysis provides actionable insights for optimizing cobot operations, such as task scheduling and performance monitoring.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the **UR3 CobotOps dataset**, which contains operational data from UR3 collaborative robots. Due to its size or licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can download it from the following link:

- [Download UR3 CobotOps Dataset](https://link-to-dataset.com)

Once downloaded, place the dataset in the `data/` directory of this project.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `pip` (Python package manager)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/UR3-CobotOps-Data-Analytics.git
   cd UR3-CobotOps-Data-Analytics

2. **Install the required dependencies**:

### Usage

To run the project, follow the steps below:

1. **Preprocess the dataset**: This script cleans and preprocesses the dataset for clustering.
    python src/preprocessing.py

2. **Run the clustering analysis**: This script applies clustering techniques (e.g., k-means, hierarchical) on the preprocessed data.
    python src/clustering.py

3. **Evaluate the results**: The evaluation script assesses the performance of the clustering models and generates visualizations.
    python src/evaluation.py

4. **View the analysis results**: Results, including any plots and performance metrics, will be saved in the reports/ folder.

### Results

1. The analysis uncovered distinct clusters in cobot operational behavior, which can be leveraged to optimize task scheduling and predict maintenance needs.
2. Detailed reports and plots can be found in the reports/ folder.
