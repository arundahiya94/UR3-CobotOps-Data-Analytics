# UR3 CobotOps ML Project

This project explores the **UR3 CobotOps dataset** using machine learning techniques, specifically clustering analysis, to uncover operational insights into collaborative robot (cobot) behavior. The analysis provides actionable insights for optimizing cobot operations, such as task scheduling and performance monitoring.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the **UR3 CobotOps dataset**, which contains operational data from UR3 collaborative robots. Due to its size or licensing restrictions, the dataset is not included in this repository. You can download it from the following link:

- [Download UR3 CobotOps Dataset](https://link-to-dataset.com)

Once downloaded, place the dataset in the `data/` directory of this project.
