# UR3 CobotOps ML Project

This project explores the **UR3 CobotOps dataset** using machine learning techniques, specifically clustering analysis, to uncover operational insights into collaborative robot (cobot) behavior. The analysis provides actionable insights for optimizing cobot operations, such as task scheduling and performance monitoring.
