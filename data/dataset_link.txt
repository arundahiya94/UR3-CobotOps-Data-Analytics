The UR3 CobotOps Dataset is an essential collection of multi-dimensional time-series data from the UR3 cobot, offering insights into operational parameters and faults for machine learning in robotics and automation. 
It features electrical currents, temperatures, speeds across joints (J0-J5), gripper current, operation cycle count, protective stops, and grip losses, collected via MODBUS and RTDE protocols. 
This dataset supports research in fault detection, predictive maintenance, and operational optimization, providing a detailed operational snapshot of a leading cobot model for industrial applications
